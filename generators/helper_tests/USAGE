Description:
    Creates helper tests for each helper you currently have,
    creating one test for each public method in the module.
    If you instead pass it a space separated set of helper
    module names you'll only generate tests for those.

Example:
    ./script/generate helper_tests

    This will create tests for all helpers that currently exist:
        test/helpers/foo_helper_test.rb
        test/helpers/bar_helper_test.rb
        test/helpers/admin/posts_helper_test.rb
        ...
        
Example with parameter:
   ./script/generate helper_tests BarHelper

   This will create only one test:
       test/helpers/bar_helper_test.rb
