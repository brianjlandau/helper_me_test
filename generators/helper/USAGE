Description:
    Creates a helper based on a camelcased or underscored name, and a 
    test file for it. It will also accept a list of method names and
    create methods for each of them and a test for each of the methods.

Example:
    ./script/generate helper Dates [method_name ...]

    This will create:
        app/helpers/dates_helper.rb
        test/helpers/dates_helper_test.rb
